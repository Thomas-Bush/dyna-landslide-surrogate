## A Deep Learning Surrogate Model for Assessment of Landslide Debris Mobility

### Abstract. 
Landslides present significant hazards, especially in densely populated areas, such as Hong Kong. This study aims to develop the first surrogate model for detailed landslide debris mobility assessment by employing a hybrid architecture that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The primary objective is to efficiently predict the spatial and temporal dynamics of landslide debris and facilitate resource-efficient modeling of potential impacts. Although the initial results reveal challenges in training a model that is fit for purpose, training on an extensive dataset from high-fidelity LS-Dyna simulations has provided crucial insights into the surrogate modelling of debris flows. These findings highlight the need for further enhancements to model sophistication and data handling. Future work will focus on refining data quality, exploring innovative neural architectures, and securing greater computational resources. 

This pioneering surrogate model initiative is foundational to advancing landslide risk assessment methodologies, significantly contributing to enhanced disaster preparedness and mitigation strategies through cutting-edge computational tools.
