Add LSTM part, see if it helps. Any other techniques for predicting a sequence? Likely going to run into resource issues.

Make a more refined, complex UNet. Same - increase layers / complexity of CNN. 


Add validation dataset

Add masking back

Add scaling of dataset

Add augmentation

Get a model, and use it to predict a sequence - can predict for as many states in the test model.

Compare overall max, and state by state difference (will likely diverge)

Convert it all to OOP
