Install Optuna

Phase 1 - Model Selection

- Use literature to justify decision - similar results found by xyz

- use inference logic in eval_pairs.


Phase 2 - Hyper Parameter Optimization

- hyper param tuning - need to do some at least. Anything to get the finer details.
- prove different loss functions - the hybrid one seemed to work quite well. But maybe needed more epochs.

Again, do on simple CNN only architecture. 

Phase 3 - LSTM hyper param?

If time, try to optimise these too. 









- document code

    - pre is done and ok.
    - model isn't done yet
    - do a search for words like "your, assume" etc

- tidy up all folders for final

- auto delete any really small velocity / thickness values and set to 0? might clean up a lot?
