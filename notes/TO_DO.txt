- check scaling works in series nb now. Need to scale back again.

- hyper param tuning - need to do some at least. Anything to get the finer details.

- check the bottom of the unet lstm - should be two lstm cells, currently lstm and linear.

- create inference code

- do some more difference plots. Train for say 60s, and get 0, 15, 30, 45, 50

- Try some different loss - MSE, MAE, want to do some loss that gives attention to the debris itself (50:50 or soemthing)
