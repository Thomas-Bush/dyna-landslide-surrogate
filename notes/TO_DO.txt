- check the bottom of the unet lstm - should be two lstm cells, currently lstm and linear

- create inference code
- Add unscaling logic for inference. Need to scale back again.
- run one of the test models through - find a good one.
    - do some more difference plots. Train for say 60s, and get 0, 15, 30, 45, 50



Experimentation

Install Optuna

Phase 1 - Model Selection
- simpler architecture, just do CNN, simple UNet, more complex UNet (match arch of final one)
- Use literature to justify decision - similar results found by xyz

Phase 2 - Hyper Parameter Optimization

- hyper param tuning - need to do some at least. Anything to get the finer details.
- prove different loss functions - the hybrid one seemed to work quite well. But maybe needed more epochs.

Again, do on simple CNN only architecture. 

Phase 3 - LSTM hyper param?

If time, try to optimise these too. 






- do some more difference plots. Train for say 60s, and get 0, 15, 30, 45, 50


- document code

- tidy up all folders for final

- auto delete any really small velocity / thickness values and set to 0? might clean up a lot?
